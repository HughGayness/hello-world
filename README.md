# hello-world
FRC 2018 Team: 7244 Huskies Robotics. Lead programmer. This is our rookie year, I have taught myself how to write rough java code with no previous experience.


I'm a graduating senior, on my way to Ferris State in August for Welding Engineering Technology. I fish all summer and like to nerd out on the XBOX when the weather sucks.
